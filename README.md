## Josh's Landing Page
I made this landing page as practice, copying the style of the reference images found under `reference-images`.
The webpage was made using HTML and CSS, with an emphasis on styling and flexbox.
The project was very enjoyable, and I learned many new webdev concepts along the way.

I took inspiration from [PakmanGames](https://github.com/PakmanGames) for this project. Thanks!
